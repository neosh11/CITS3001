# CITS3001

This project is a game playing agent for Moss Side Whist. A variation of whist with 3 players.

We ended up with 2 quite a powerful agents, unfortunately they haven't been added to this repo yet.

The agents use bits to store decks of cards for extremely fast processing. A massive boost of more than 100x with a monte-carlo method and a greedy method
